Julia scripts associated with "A White Noise Approach to Evolutionary Ecology" by (Week et. al. (2020))[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.226001v1] for simulating branching Brownian motions and other measure-valued branching processes, approximating their diffusion limits, solving associated SPDE and solving SDE corresponding to an eco-evolutionary model of a competitive community.
